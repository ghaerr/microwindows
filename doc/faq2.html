<h1>Microwindows Frequently Asked Questions - Part 2</h1>

<p>2016/02/28 Microwindows FAQ2<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Where is the configure file?</h3>

<p>Microwindows does not have a configure file. For Linux it uses a makefile based build system.<br>
This are several linked Makefiles and *.rules files which are called recursively. To customise<br>
this for the various platforms there is a config file which you can edit. Examples of this<br>
config file for different platforms are in the src/Configs directory.<br>
<br>

In addition for specific platforms there are special makefiles. So there is the<br>
Makefile_nr, a non-recursive makefile for MinGW and DOS or the Makefile.rtems for the RTEMS<br>
system etc.<br>
<br>

The Makefile, which is used for Linux, includes the Path.rules file and the config file<br>
mentioned above. Then it includes the Makefile.rules file where make will continue.<br>
Makefile.rules has the targets for Make and calls the Makefiles in the subdirectories.<br>
This is the file where the main action for make is. It also includes Arch.rules which <br>
contains special settings for the different platforms supported.<br>
<br>

The Makefiles in the subdirectories will also include the Path.rules file and the config file<br>
plus Objects.rules files. Then they recursively call the Makefile.rules file again to compile<br> 
their files. There are also clean and install targets in Makefile.rules and the Makefiles in<br>
the subdirectories.<br>
<br>

This Makefile system works well but is difficult to modify if it does not work on a new platform.<br>
Therefore there are additional Makefiles provided which are designed more simple and can easily<br>
be adapted to new platforms.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>What are the NXlib and PXlib libraries?</h3>

<p>Since nano-X is not fully compatible to X11 it is quite some work to port X11 applications to<br>
nano-X. NXlib is a wrapper library for nano-X which does provide X11 compatibility.<br>
<br>
Users of Microwindows currently mainly want to port X11 applications to it. Writing applications<br>
based on nano-X from scratch is rarely done. So applications are now based on NX11 instead of<br>
nano-X directly. Furthermore applications now are not based on X11 directly but using a GUI toolkit.<br>
For NX11 this is FLTK which can be based well on NX11.<br>
<br>
If you link an application with libNXlib you also have to link it with libnano-X, i.e. -lNXlib and -lnano-X.<br>
<br>
PXlib is a library that is NXlib plus nano-X compiled together. So when porting applications to <br>
Microwindows you do not have to replace -lX11 with both -lNX11 and -lnano-X any more, just -lPXlib <br>
will do.<br>
<br>
Before this release NXlib was a separate archive to download. It now is added as a subdirectory to the<br>
Microwindows package.<br>
<br>
Initially NXlib was implemented as the XtoNX.h header file.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>What is the NXext library?</h3>

<p>Some programs require the libXext library to compile. To help supporting these programs libNXext provides<br>
stubs for the functions included in libXext.<br>
<br></p>


<h3>How to compile a program using the Nano-X or NXlib libraries on the command line?</h3>
Nano-X:<br>
<br>
First make e.g. a "mytests" folder in the "microwindows/src" directory. Copy e.g. the "src/demos/nanox/arcdemo.c" program<br>
into the "mytests" folder. Then, while in the "src" folder, enter:<br>
<br>
"gcc -Llib -Iinclude mytests/arcdemo.c -lnano-X -o mytests/arcdemo"<br>
<br>
This will compile the arcdemo program in the mytests folder. To run the program enter, while in the "src" directory,<br> 
the following line:<br>
<br>
"bin/nano-X -N & bin/nanowm & mytests/arcdemo"<br>
<br>
Calling "bin/nanwm" adds a Nano-X window manager background window. On some platforms you need to add some delays:<br>
"bin/nano-X -N & sleep 1; bin/nanowm & sleep 1; mytests/arcdemo & sleep 10000"<br>
<br>
NXlib:<br>
<br>
To use the NXlib library copy e.g. the "src/nxlib/test/xgreen.c" program into the "mytests" folder. <br>
Then, while in the "src" folder, enter:<br>
<br>
"gcc -Llib -Iinclude mytests/xgreen.c -lnano-X -lNX11 -o mytests/xgreen"<br>
<br>
This will compile the xgreen program in the mytests folder. To run the program enter, while in the "src" directory, <br> 
the following line:<br>
<br>
"bin/nano-X -N & bin/nanowm & mytests/xgreen"<br>
<br>
To use the PX11 library compile with: "gcc -Llib -Iinclude mytests/xgreen.c -lPX11 -o mytests/xgreen" <br> 
and run with: "bin/nano-X -N & bin/nanowm & mytests/xgreen"<br>
<br>
</p>


<h3>How to use Microwindows and FLTK on the Android platform?</h3>

<p>There is a separate application note in this directory for Android.<br>
<br>
</p>


<h3>How to compile FLTK for Microwindows?</h3>

<p>For this you should compile Microwindows with the config.fltk file in the configs directory. Rename config<br>
in the src directory to e.g. config.default and then copy the config.fltk file as config into the src directory.<br>
When using the X11 platform, leave SHAREDLIBS=Y and LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER=N.
<br><br>
Download FLTK 1.3.x and cd into the fltk directory. Then enter:<br>
<br>
./configure --x-includes=/home/test/src/nanoX/nxlib/X11 \<br>
  --x-libraries=/home/test/src/nanoX/microwin/src/lib \<br>
  --disable-gl \<br>
  --disable-xinerama \<br>
  --disable-xft  \<br>
  --disable-xdbe \<br>
  --disable-xfixes<br>
<br>
Then replace the "-lX11 and -lXext" entries with "-lNX11 -lnano-X" or "-lPX11" in makeinclude <br>
and fltk-config. You can use the replace-lX11.sh script in the microwindows/src directory for that.<br>
You can run that script once with makeinclude entered on the command line and once with fltk-config specified <br>
on the command line.<br>
However, behind the -lPX11 parameter in makeinclude you have to add "-lfreetype" to get<br>
FLTK to compile.<br>
<br>
If you are using Microwindows on the Linux X11 platform, you will need to make a patch to the FLTK source code<br>
since FLTK will dynamically load XRANDR support when starting and that causes your program to crash immediately.<br>
So open the file "src/Fl_x.cxx" and add the line "#undef USE_XRANDR" right after the line<br>
"#define USE_XRANDR (HAVE_DLSYM && HAVE_DLFCN_H)" which currently is line 51. This will avoid that XRANDR support<br>
will be loaded.<br>
<br>
Then enter make in the fltk directory. If you enter make -k it will not stop when trying to compile the sudoku game.<br>
It may stop at the UTF-8 program, but the examples and FLTK will work anyway.<br> 
<br> 
If you want to compile a program from the command line you can enter:<br> 
"g++ test/hello.cxx -o hello -Llib  -lPX11 -lfreetype -lfltk -ldl"<br>
<br>
Then you can run the examples, however, you will find that the fonts do not work, you just get the small default font.<br>
To enable truetype fonts you can either copy the fonts.alias file example from the "src/nxlib/fonts" directory into the truetype<br>
directory into e.g. "/usr/share/fonts/truetype" using sudo. Or you change the selected fonts from FLTK by modifying<br>
the font names in the file "fltk-1.3.2/src/fl_font_x.cxx" if you are comfortable with XLFD descriptions.<br>
<br>
If you are not using the X11 platform and have set LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER=Y in the microwindows config file, you can start <br>
the examples with "test/hello".<br>
If have set this macro to N as required for X11 you have to use a script like that: "nano-X & nanowm & test/hello & sleep 10000".<br>
On some platforms these commands do not work from the command line, just from a script. After terminating the <br>
application you have to terminate this script with CTRL-C.<br>
Also, sometimes the application window hides behind other windows.<br>
<br>
Additional details are provided by Ian MacArthur here:  <a href="http://www.fltk.org/articles.php?L1352+I60+T+P1+Q">Article #1352</a><br>
This article now refers to an earlier version of Microwindows and thus is partially deprecated now. The NX11 library does not <br>
need to be compiled separately any more and you do not need to remove VNC or patch the image_png.c and Text16.c files.<br> 
You can use -PX11 instead of -lNX11 and -lnano-X now.<br>
<br>
There is also flnx which is a modified version of FLTK 1.1 to work with nano-X before<br>
NXlib was availabe. Flnx is deprecated now.<br>
<br>
</p>


<h3>My application does not use truetype fonts! It uses just a small fixed font.</h3>

<p>This means Microwindows has not found any truetype fonts on your platform und uses the default<br>
system font.<br>
<br>
Microwindows comes with a fonts directory which contains a number of fonts. You can copy that<br>
into your application directory where your application then will usually find them.<br>
Nano-X uses the path "fonts/truetype" as default.<br>
<br>
NXlib will also scan the /usr/share/fonts directory for available fonts.<br>
<br>
If your application requests fonts that are not available, you can set up a fonts.alias file<br>
which will map the requested fonts to other fonts that are availabe. For DOS this file is<br>
called fonts.ali. You can also use a fonts.alias file if you only want to provide just a few fonts<br>
with your application to reduce the disk space required.<br>
<br>
Finally you can specify the path to the truetype fonts on your system by setting the global<br>
variable "TTFONTDIR" to this path. This variable is read by nano-X when searching for the truetype font.<br>
<br>
</p>


<h3>How to compile on Windows with MinGW?</h3>

<p>The MinGW port is based on the Allegro graphics library and the Makefile_nr file. You can<br>
edit this file to use either Allegro4 or Allegro5. Depending on the Allegro library you specify<br>
for linking it will be linked statically or as a shared library. If you link with a shared<br>
library you have to distribute the corresponding Allegro dll with your application.<br>
<br>
Do not select png or jpeg in the Makefile_nr file since these are only used for the nano-X demos<br>
or other nano-X applications.<br>
<br>
So download a binary version of Allegro for MinGW or compile Allegro with MinGW.<br>
<br>
Run "make -f Makefile_nr" to compile Microwindows for MinGW.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>How to use Allegro5 on a Linux platform?</h3>

<p>There is an Allegro macro defined in the config file. If you set that the Allegro drivers<br>
are compiled in and the Allegro library is linked with nano-X. Currently only Allegro5 does work<br> 
with Nano-X applications, NX11/FLTK does not work. Allegro4 does not yet work on Linux.<br>
<br></p>

<h3>How to use SDL as a Microwindows backend?</h3>

<p>There are SDL macros defined in the config file. You can select either SDL1 (version 1.2) or SDL2.<br>
After you set these macros as required the SDL1 or SDL2 drivers are compiled in and the <br>
relevant SDL library is linked with nano-X. Currently only SDL2 works with NXlib/PXlib.<br> 
<br></p>

<h3>How to compile for DOS?</h3>

<p>To use Microwindows on DOS you need to compile with DJGPP. Once you have that set up use the<br>
makedos.bat file to compile. This batch file calls "make -f Makefile_nr ARCH=DOS".<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>How to port a Linux application to Microwindows?</h3>

<p>
Since the configure script of the new application will not find NXlib or PXlib, it will look for <br>
standard X11.<br>
<br>
However, after you run ./configure on your Linux system you can edit the resulting Makefile and <br>
replace in it the references to the "-lX11 and -lXext" libraries with "-lNX11 -lnano-X" or just <br>
"-lPX11". Many applications will compile then.<br>
<br>
You can also use the <b>replace-lX11.sh script</b> in the src directory to replace "-lX11 and -lXext" in a<br>
Makefile or any other file for you. Enter the name of the makefile on the command line when executing<br>
this script and it will replace "-lX11" and -lXext" with "-lNX11 and remove "-lXext" in this file.<br>
<br>
You can also add "-e" as the second parameter. In this case "-lXext" will be replaced with "-lNXext".<br>
"libNXext" is a library with stubs for the functions in the "libXext" library. You can use this if the<br>
application you want to port uses functions from the libXext library.<br>
<br>
The alternative is to modify the automake files so configure will generate a makefile that uses PXlib <br>
instead of Xlib and Xext.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>How to add new drivers to Microwindows?</h3>

<p>Follow e.g. the SDL example. Typically you will add a macro which selects the new drivers into the config file. <br>
Then set the library your drivers may need to link with in Makefile.rules and the drivers to compile with <br>
Microwindows in drivers/Objects.rules.<br>
<br>
Also check the files "nanox/srvmain" und "mwin/winmain". These contain #if / #elseif statements for <br>
different platforms which you will have to set for your platform too.<br>
<br></p>


<h3>Does Microwindows support GTK or QT?</h3>
<p>
This are applications which are too large to be ported to Microwindows.<br>
<br>
There is NanoGTK which is GTK version 1.2 ported to nano-X. With NXlib it is also possible to compile GTK1.<br>
However, today there are almost no applications using GTK1 since that is not compatible with GTK2.<br>
<br>
Greg Haerr did some tests with an early version of QT (qt-x11-2.3.1).<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Should I use mwin or nano-X?</h3>
<p>In the early days of the Microwindows project there was a need for a GUI with widgets and dialogs.<br> 
It was decided to implement that as an Windows API compatible library called libmwin. So if you prefer<br> 
to code on the Windows API level you can use that. This library provides a Windows compatible API that<br>
can be used on any platfrom that Microwindows will run on.<br>
<br>
The Microwindows library therefore has two APIs: one is Windows API compatible (mwin) and one is<br>
X11 compatible (nano-X with NXlib).<br>
<br>
With the current support for FLTK it is usually better to start an application based on that. FLTK is a<br>
more extensive GUI toolkit than the Windows API compatible mwin library.<br>
<br>
</p>


<h3>Can you use Java with Microwindows?</h3>
<p>
Greg Haerr got <a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</a> to work with Microwindows. This way you can run Java with Microwindows.<br>
<br>
</p>


<h3>How to use Microwindows with ELKS?</h3>
<p>
ELKS is 16bit version of Linux. The website is: http://elks.sourceforge.net/<br>
Due to memory constraints ELKS does support version 0.86 of Microwindows only. This has been reenabled in the year 2017 and added <br>
to the ELKS package. Details about this port are availabe at: https://github.com/jbruchon/elks/blob/master/nano-X/Readme-ELKS <br>
<br>
</p>


<h3>Why does printf not work?</h3>
<p>If you set DEBUG = Y in the config file, printf statements you add into the code will work. Otherwise<br>
Microwindows uses a #define macro to disable printf statements in the code.<br>
<br>
Microwindows uses the DPRINTF/EPRINTF macros in debug mode to print information to the console<br>
window. These are defined in the src/include/device.h header file.<br>
<br>
If the HAVE_FPRINTF macro, also defined in this header file, is set to 0 in e.g. Arch.rules, fprintf/printf <br>
will no longer work. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>My mouse wheel does not work!</h3>
<p>Nano-X and NXlib do support the mouse wheel, but not all mouse drivers in the drivers directory are adapted<br>
to report more than three mouse buttons yet. Currently only the gpm, x11 and Allegro mouse driver report the <br>
up- and down wheel movement.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Why are there so many warnings in debug mode?</h3>
<p>The majority of the code was written over ten years ago and gcc constantly increased the number of warnings<br>
from release to release. In debug mode the code is compiled with the -Wall parameter plus requesting some<br>
additional warnings. This causes all these warnings with the old code base and it would take a very long<br>
time to remove all these now.<br>
<br>
In release mode the -Wall parameter is not set and Microwindows compiles with just a few warnings.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Why does make fail if I use the '-j' or '--jobs' option?</h3>
<p> The Microwindows makefile is written as a recursive makefile and therefore cannot be run with this option.<br>
<br>
You can set MICROWIN = N and MICROWINDEMO = N in the config file to reduce compile time if you will <br>
use the X11 compatible API only. If you do not need the demo applications you can set NANOXDEMO = N too.<br>
<br></p>


<h3>What difference does the LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER macro make? - Linking options in config</h3>
<p>
Microwindows can be compiled to a separate server and window manager and the application linked with<br>
the nano-X.a or mwin.a library will have the client part that communicates via sockets with this server.<br>
So you first have to load nano-X and nanowm before starting your application. A typical script for that<br>
looks like this: "bin/nano-X & bin/nanowm & bin/$progname".<br>
<br>
If you set the LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER macro to "Y" Microwindows will compile to a single nano-X.a library and not <br>
generate separate nano-X server und nanowm window manager programs. The client and server parts plus the window <br>
manager are linked together to one library. If you link your application with this library, you do not have to <br>
load the server before the application, you can just click on the application in your file manager and that will <br>
start it. You can also start your application from the command line as a single program.<br>
<br>
The window manager will be build only if you set the NANOWM macro to "Y". Otherwise the application will run<br>
without this window manager and thus without window decorations.<br>
<br>
If you set the SHAREDLIBS macro to "Y" the nano-X, NXlib etc. libraries are compiled as shared libries in<br>
addition to being compiled to static libaries. So the application does not have to link statically with nano-X<br> 
or NX11 but can load these dynamically at runtime. You find all these libraries in the "src/lib" directory.<br>
<br></p>


<h3>How can I uninstall the Microwindows files from the /usr directory?</h3>
<p>
There is the "cleanusr" target in the makefile for that. So "sudo make cleanusr" will remove the files from /usr/bin,<br>
/usr/lib and if availabe /usr/lib64.<br>
<br></p>
