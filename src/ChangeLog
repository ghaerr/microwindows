Version 0.93 - 15 Nov 2011 - Entirely new fast blitting model with conversion blits and alpha compositing
15 Nov 2011
	* fix termcs1 freetype kluge, add MWTF_CMAP_DEFAULT/0/1 charmap select to GdSetFontAttr
26 Sep 2011
	* added MWTF_BOLD flag to GrSetFontAttr to simulate bold fonts using FT2, nonrotated only
	* deprecate demos/nanox/move.c demo
30 Jul 2011
	* Nintendo DS port, added MWPF_TRUECOLOR1555 format (Derek Carter)
	* add Standard Event mouse/kbd drivers (/dev/input/event0) EVENTMOUSE/EVENTKBD config (David Rizzo)
	* updated DJGPP support in contrib/djgpp, GRX lib and VESA (Georg Potthast)

19 Feb 2011
	* remove GsError() in GrSetFocus to fix FLTK 1.1.10 crash/desync problem (Martin)
	* fix scr_fb.c typo
	* NOTE: unlike v0.92, config SCREEN_PIXTYPE _must_ be set to target framebuffer pixel format.
		The convblit routines use RGB2PIXEL/RED2PIXEL macros which fail when converting
		to 16bpp, and GdDrawImage display is incorrect.  The inability to use
		multiple fb pixel formats selected at runtime will be fixed soon.
10 Jan 2011
	* fix slow fbe startup creating framebuffer
8 Jan 2011
	* prelim C++ linkages: agg rasterizer demo (src/agglite), canny edge detector src/canny)

		must set fg and possibly bg color and usebg when calling GrCopyArea with
			palette (1,2,4,8 bpp) pixmap to truecolor (higher bpp) pixmap
			for 1bpp pixmap conversion, fg/bg color used is bit 0 of MWCOLORVAL
	* cleaned up MWIMAGEINFO, added MWIF_PAL1 1bpp option to GdCreatePixmap
31 Dec 2010
	* cleanup jpeg loader, forces pal8 in palette mode else pal8 or RGB888 from image
	* remove sscanf from xpm and pnm loaders
	* remove bytesperpixel from image/psd header and  GrGetImageInfo return
	* cleanup xpm loader, force pal8 image in palette mode else RGBA8888
30 Dec 2010
	* auto image upgrade to RGBA if not running in palette mode and no convblit available
		this allows very fast drawing of .gifs and other 8bpp palettized images
29 Dec 2010
	* fix GdDrawImagePartToFit, test in composite.c
	* all image loaders use PSD, not MWIMAGEHDR
	* fix 16bpp driver rop bugs

	* GR_IMAGE_ID id's are now pixmap id's and can be drawn on (no duplicate id's)
	* GdLoadImageFromFile/Buffer use PSD not MWIMAGEHDR, remove GdFreeImage
	* rearranged MWIMAGEHDR/SCREENDEVICE to have shared header data members
		MWIMAGEHDR structure changed, image .c files need convbmp regeneration

	* rewrote dwswap/wswap endian reversal routines in bmp loaders, cleanup bmp reader/writers
	* swap.h tries to automatically determine CPU endianness, new host_to_little_endian_32/16
	* remove/fix duplicate bmp decoder in mwin/winresbmp.c, must set HAVE_BMP_SUPPORT for win32 bmps
24 Dec 2010
	* ctrl-quit (f15) will save screen contents to screen.bmp
	* added DEBUG_EXPOSE and DEBUG_BLIT to flash yellow/brown on expose/blit areas
	* fix/rewrite GdCaptureScreen to use framebuffer rather than /dev/fb0
23 Dec 2010
	* fix corner resize off by 2 bug
	* buffered windows never displayed until GrFlushWindow called, remove GR_WM_PROPS_NODRAWONRESIZE
		internal GR_WM_PROPS_DRAWING_DONE flag to indicate drawing finalized by calling GrFlushWindow
	* unset GR_WM_PROPS_BUFFERED releases buffer, window can be used normally
	* fixed buffered window background clear clipping bug (pixmap using root window clipregion)
	* added GrNewBufferedWindow for quick buffered windows, same parameters as GrNewWindowEx
	* added debug yellow clear rects for visual expose area and blit clip region display

22 Dec 2010
	* optimized GrResizeWindow exposure for no blink
	* added OSX/iOS-style buffered windows! use GR_WM_PROPS_BUFFERED flags in GrNewWindowEx
		(demo in demos/nanox/composite.c, fontdemo.c, src/compositedemo.sh, fontdemo.sh)
		Quick conversion for double buffered windows in any application:
			add GR_WM_PROPS_BUFFERED to GrNewWindowEx flags
			add GR_WM_PROPS_NOBACKGROUND if app paints background
			add GrFlushWindow(wid) call in paint routine
			add update mask and handling for GR_UPDATE_MAP & GR_UPDATE_SIZE and call paint routine
			remove Exposure mask and event handling
		Buffered windows allocate a 32bpp RGBA pixmap for automatic offscreen buffered drawing.
		Pixmap is erased to bg color on create and resize unless GR_WM_PROPS_NOBACKGROUND set
		On window expose, buffered contents are copied, app never gets expose events.
		App must process resize and map Update events, flush buffer with GrFlushWindow(wid)
	* fix memory leak with background pixmap windows
21 Dec 2010
	* fix optimization problem with DEBUG=Y, now -O3 with DEBUG, not -O0

	  and save battery.
	- The GetMessage function, when waiting for a message, call
	  MwHandleTimers and if requested the idle_handler fn.

Version 0.89pl7 - 24 Feb 2003 - greg@censoft.com
	* APPLIED mw_phillips_fontnetworkbug.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* Added GrCreateLogFont nxRequest.
	* Removing the hardcoded 64-character limit on font names.
	  This caused problems with FreeType 2, because the font names
	  are just filenames.  The network layer no longer
	  restricts font name length, but there is still a
	  potential buffer overflow in devfont.c.

	* APPLIED mw_phillips_freetype2.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* Added FreeType 2 support, HAVE_FREETYPE_2_SUPPORT in config

	* APPLIED mw_phillips_drawarea.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* Added new DrawArea blitters.  Controlled by the defines
	   MW_FEATURE_PSDOP_COPY, MW_FEATURE_PSDOP_ALPHAMAP,
	   MW_FEATURE_PSDOP_ALPHACOL,
	   MW_FEATURE_PSDOP_BITMAP_BYTES_LSB_FIRST, and
	   MW_FEATURE_PSDOP_BITMAP_BYTES_MSB_FIRST in device.h.
	   Usually called through GdDrawAreaInternal() in devdraw.c.

	* fixed nxroach GrArea alpha bug (BLACK used in GrArea crash)

	* APPLIED mw_phillips_alpha.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* Adds 8-bit alpha value to MWCOLORVAL value, new fblin32alpha.c
	* Added MWPF_TRUECOLOR8888 pixel type.
	* Adding MWIMAGE_ALPHA_CHANNEL flag.
	* Changes to GdDrawImage() to simplify, fix a
	  24bpp bug, and to add the MWIMAGE_ALPHA_CHANNEL flag.
	* Adding MWROP_USE_GC_MODE option to GrCopyArea
	* Adding a default implementation to fb.h for the new Porter-Duff
	  blending rules, which assumes that both SRC and DST have
	  alpha=1.0.  Drivers that actually support alpha should not
	  use these macros in Porter-Duff modes.
	* MWMODE_XOR_FGBG implementation
	* Adding Porter-Duff MWMODE and MWROP codes,
	  renumbering some existing MWROP codes to prevent collisions.
	  Adding MWMODE_XOR_FGBG and MWROP_XOR_FGBG
	* Adding MWMODE_TO_ROP() macro.
	* Adding code to choose between 8/8/8/8 and 0/8/8/8
	  modes on 32-bit displays, depending on whether or not the
	  display claims to support alpha.
	* New 32-bit with alpha driver: fblin32alpha.c.
	* Adding GR_ARGB() - just calls MWARGB().
	* Rewriting MWRGB() to set the alpha to 255 (opaque).
	* Adding MWARGB() macro
	* Use new GrSetGCForegroundPixelVal() API rather than the
	  deprecated MWPALINDEX() macro.
	  *** NON-BACKWARDS-COMPATIBLE API CHANGE: ***
	  Removing MWF_PALINDEX and MWPALINDEX().  They don't work
	  due to the alpha blending changes.  Clients should be
	  modified to use GrSetGCForegroundPixelVal(index) instead
	  of GrSetGCForeground(MWPALINDEX(index)), and similarly to use
	  GrSetGCBackgroundPixelVal() to set the background color.

	* APPLIED mw_phillips_color.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* API changes to allow later alpha patch.
	* Added GrSetGCForegroundPixelVal, GrSetGCBackgroundPixelVal
	* Added new functions GdSetForegroundColor() and GdSetBackgroundColor
		GdSetForeground/GdSetBackground now takes MWPIXELVAL only.
	* Added fgispixelval and bgispixelval flags to GR_GC and GR_GC_INFO.
	* Added a PSD parameter to GdSetForeground() and GdSetBackground(),
		GdFindColor().  Allows multiple color depths to be supported
		at the same time by different PSDs
	* (wingdi.c) Using GdGetColorRGB() instead of a switch()
	  statement that duplicated it's functionality.
	* Replacing GdSetForeground(GdFindColor(c))
	  with GdSetForegroundColor(psd,c) - note the extra PSD
	  parameter.  Similarly for GdSetBackgroundColor().
	* New function GdGetColorRGB(), the inverse of GdFindColor().
	* Preventing multiple arc draws - this was causing
	  problems in XOR and alpha-blending drawing modes.

	* APPLIED mw_phillips_x11.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* Major speed enhancements to X11 screen driver.
	* Resizing the window caused an assert() fail and
	  crash.  Added a call to set size hints on the window, indicating
	  it's not resizable.
	* Handle true color X modes correctly.  The previous
	  code made the assumption that a X always lays out it's colors
	  in exactly the same way as MicroWindows.  This is incorrect.
	  For example, some Microsoft Windows based X servers use BGR
	  rather than RGB ordering.
	* If we are in true color mode, then we try hard to
	  get a true color X window if the server can support it.  This
	  is a huge speed boost with a 32-bit Nano-X app, properly
	  antialiased fonts (so we use lots of colors) and an old 8-bit
	  palettised display.  (In 3/3/2 RGB mode we can compute color
	  values easily.  In 8-bit palettised mode we have to do a very
	  expensive lookup).
	* An alternative blit implementation.  Since we are
	  maintaining a separate off-screen copy of the display, we
	  perform all blits on this copy, then simply copy the offscreen
	  data onto the screen.  The only exception are simple copies (no
	  raster ops) between parts of the screen - these are handled by
	  the server to save us having to send an image across the
	  connection.
	* Added PIXEL332RED8 and PIXEL332RED32 macros to device.h

	* APPLIED mw_phillips_1.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* Misc build system changes.
