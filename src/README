Microwindows Configuration Documentation
May 21, 2019 g haerr <greg@censoft.com>

To build Microwindows for desktop demonstration:

1. cd microwindows/src

2. The default configuration is for MAC OSX running X11 (Configs/config.macosx).
   For Linux X11 type "cp Configs/config.linux-X11 config".
   For Linux hardware framebuffer type "cp Configs/config.linux-fb config".
   For Linux framebuffer emulation on X11 type "cp Configs/config.linux-fbe config".
   For SDL on OSX type "cp Configs/config.sdl config".

   Edit the default configuration file "config" for library support desired.

   There are (outdated) pre-built configuration files for a variety
   of target systems, see Configs/README.
   See microwindows/doc/CONTENTS.txt and microwindows/src/Configs/README for more information.

3. Type "make"

4.  Run the demonstration programs using "./runapp <appname>".

	Any application in microwindows/src/bin/ can be run using the application launch
	script, runapp, which automatically starts the nano-X server if required.
	Some examples:

	./runapp demo-aafont
	./runapp demo-nuklear-overview
	./runapp demo-composite
	./runapp mwdvetest
	./runapp mwmine

	./runapp can be used to set the Nano-X portrait modes using -L, -R, -D, -A
	(left, right, upside down, auto-mouseedge) when running Nano-X apps, e.g.:

	./runapp -A demo-ttfont		(move mouse to edges of screen to demonstragte flip orientation)

	The runapp shell script sets up and exports LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the
	required shared libraries are loaded from microwindows/src/lib/ when
	configured with SHAREDLINK=Y. To link the demo programs
	with Microwindows static libraries, set SHAREDLINK=N.

	Microwindows by default builds both .a and shared libraries.
	To not generate any shared libraries, set SHAREDLIBS=N.

	For the EMSCRIPTEN port, check that the EMSDK is in ~/emsdk/, then compilation
	is done after copying Configs/config.emscripten to src/config and running
	./make-emscripten.  Applications are run as above but using ./emrun:

	./emrun demo-aafont
	./emrun mwdemo2
	./emrun mwmine
	./emrun mwapp		(multiple win32 apps simultaneously)

	If MICROWINMULTIAPP=Y is set in config, win32 apps will be compiled as shared
	libraries and be loadable dynamically, now supporting multiple simultaneous
	application execution. These bin/mw*.so apps are loaded using the mwapp loader:

	bin/mwapp					(demo win32 apps simultaneously)
	bin/mwapp mwdemo2			(to run a single app)
	bin/mwapp mwdemo mwterm		(to run just specified apps)

5. Documentation is available in the microwindows/doc directory.
	Complete browser accessible API documentation is at doc/nano-X/index.html
	Win32 API documentation is in doc/html/Win32API.html
	NXLIB API documentation is in doc/html/NXlib programming and reference manual.html
	PDF documentation is in doc/pdf

6. More information below.

Microwindows compiles and runs on Linux, MACOSX, UNIX, X11, EMSCRIPTEN, Android, PSP,
RTEMS, MinGW and bare hardware.  There is support for the MIPS,
ARM, and x86 cpu's using the cross compiler toolchains specified in config.

Use "make -f Makefile_nr ARCH=XXX" to compile for MinGW or DOS-DJGPP.

Microwindows can be compiled to use different screen, 
mouse and keyboard drivers for a given operating system environment.
Most options are set using configuration file (microwindows/src/config) options.
These options are manually editted.
Other fine-tuning options are set in the graphics drawing engine's header
file microwindows/src/include/device.h.

After changing any options in microwindows/src/config, Microwindows
is built by typing "make".

Microwindows' header files can be written to /usr/lib/microwin,
and libraries to /usr/lib by typing "sudo make install".  This
is not required unless using Microwindows to build outside
applications, however.  All demos build and run using the headers
and libraries built in the source tree.

Config options are detailed in the config file itself and
following each operating environment below.  Setting the line
	MICROWIN=Y
will build Microwindows libraries.  The line
	NANOX=Y
will build Nano-X libraries.  Both are built by default.
	NX11=Y will build the libNX11 X11-compatibility library used with libnano-X.

Setting OPTIMIZE=Y will run the compiler's -O3 switch.
Setting DEBUG=Y will add -g.  Setting VERBOSE=Y will display
the full compiler command line when making.  When cross-compiling
for different platforms, the various XXXTOOLSPREFIX values
must be set accordingly.

The Nano-X server can be built as a compiled-in application,
or use UNIX sockets to allow seperately compiled applications
to connect to the server.  Setting the line
	LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER=Y
will create libnanoX and all demos with the server files necessary to create
a standalone nano-X application, which is useful for debugging,
or for not having to run a seperate client/server connection
to the nano-X server. The downside is that multiple applications
cannot be run simultaneously.

Scaled, rotated, and antialiased fonts (truetype and adobe type 1)
are supported using Freetype 2. Set
	HAVE_FREETYPE_2_SUPPORT=Y
in the config file. For Adobe Type 1 font support, download
t1lib-1.0.tar.gz from microwindows.org or 
ftp://ftp.neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/pub/software/t1lib/
and set:
	HAVE_T1LIB_SUPPORT=Y
in the config file.  The demo-ttfont, demo-aafont and demop-font  programs demonstrate
use of both truetype and type 1 fonts.

If compiling for use with multi-threaded applications, setting
	THREADSAFE=Y (default)
enables a global mutex around all GrXXX() functions.
This is necessary when using Nano-X with the SDL library and SMPEG.

All the demos are built in the microwindows/src/bin directory. 

A set of demonstration scripts running multiple applications are available in
microwindows/src/demoscripts/*.sh.

Linux/UNIX
==========
Linux users set the line below in the config file.
	ARCH=LINUX-NATIVE

UNIX/Linux users have the choice of running framebuffer screen drivers, X11 or SDL.
The framebuffer driver runs on 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32bpp systems.
To choose between them, set one of the following lines in the config file:
	SCREEN=FB		(for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 bpp linear fb access)
	SCREEN=X11
	SCREEN=SDL		(for SDL version 2)
	SCREEN=FBE		(for framebuffer emulator bin/fbe, set FBEMULATOR=Y also)

When building the X11 version, the SCREEN_PIXTYPE can be used
to emulate a different hardware framebuffer configuration.
See the config file SCREEN_PIXTYPE= for more details, the default
is 32 bit color in ARGB format.

Linux framebuffer users can use either the /dev/input/mice driver,
the GPM mouse driver, or a "bare" serial mouse driver that decodes
the mouse directly from the serial port.  Set one of the following in config:
	MOUSE=DEVMICEMOUSE
	MOUSE=GPMMOUSE
	MOUSE=SERMOUSE
	MOUSE=NOMOUSE		(for no mouse)

Note that to use the GPM driver, you must start GPM with
the -R option, and usually specify the mouse type with -t.
See mouse.sh for an example.  If using the direct serial
mouse driver, the serial port may have to be specified in
microwindows/src/drivers/mou_ser.c, as it defaults to /dev/psaux,
and expects a ps2-compatible mouse (changeable in mou_ser.c
or through environment variables MOUSE_TYPE={ms,pc,logi,ps2},
and MOUSE_PORT=/dev/ttyS1).

There is a utility that converts MS fonts, for exact
MS-Windows look and feel.  You must own a MS license in order
to use an MS font.  To use the MS fonts, compile microwindows/src/fonts/tools/convfnt.c
on a Windows system, and it will create the win*.c font tables.
These fonts can then be linked in by modifying the drivers/genfont.c file.

DJGPP and others
================
There are contributed DJGPP and MINGW32 ports.
Instructions are in microwindows/src/Makefile_nr.

Framebuffer notes:
If you haven't used any of the Linux 2.2 or 2.4 framebuffer drivers before,
it can be a little daunting at first. Alex Buell has written a
Framebuffer HOWTO, which is available at
http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Framebuffer-HOWTO.html which goes into detail about the
various drivers, command line options, and the fbset utility.
For any frame buffer other than the Vesa framebuffer
(which can only change modes at bootup because it needs to
execute the code in the video card's ROM in real mode),
you can change bits per pixel with the command 'fbset -depth {8|16|24|32}'.
Another very useful framebuffer site is http://www.linux-fbdev.org

Have fun!
