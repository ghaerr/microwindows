Microwindows and Nano-X port for the Atari Jaguar contributed by

It is more a proof-of-concept at this point.
No efforts have been done to support the console capabilities yet.
Only the cpu (M68000) is used, and the performances are fine.

This port follows the rules provided in the original source and docs.
The src/Configs/config.ajaguar contains the definitions for the console.
Once copied in the src directory as config file, it can be edited to fit the need.

To build the library, first make sure a m68k compiler is in your PATH, then:

   cd src
   make -f makefile_ajaguar ARCH=AJAGUAR

The demos will also be compiled but not linked.
It requires additional work to make the demos run on the console.
Such work implies use of core, maths and low-level runtime libraries.
Most of the demos run fine and screenshots show some of them in action.
