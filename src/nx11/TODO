These may need to be moved over for desktop and other stuff to work.  

allow mwin to take pixelval rather than colorval in COLORVAL routines

change to Query Truecolor or not for display

think about GrReadArea return size based on MWPF_xxx
	should it be based on bpp?  no.


is Cursor black/white reversed? (X11 bits reverse meaning?)

Region.c local regions?
