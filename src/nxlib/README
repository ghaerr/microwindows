NXLIB X11 Emulation Library for Nano-X

These source files build an X11 -> Nano-X conversion library,
allowing binaries compiled for X11 to run unmodified on a
Microwindows based system, using the Nano-X API.

This software has been used to run the following libraries
and applications, although much work is yet to be completed:

fltk-1.0.11
fltk-1.1.10
gtk+-1.2.7, glib-1.2.7
gtk+-1.2.10, glib-1.2.10
gtk+-2.0.6, glib-2.0.6, atk-1.0.3, pango-1.0.4
qt-x11-2.3.1
xfreecell-1.0.5a
xsunclock-1.5
xscreensaver-3.26

See INSTALL for build and installation instructions.

See LICENSE for the licensing agreement.

See ChangeLog for change information.

There is an NXlib programming and reference manual available in the "microwindows/doc" directory.
